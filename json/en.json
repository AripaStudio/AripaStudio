That‚Äôs where I got introduced to software development and began practicing and working on small projects.After some time, I started making games with Godot Mono and developed a passion for game development.In fact, even before programming, I was very interested in game development because of my love for writing.Now, I work on both game development and programming, but I‚Äôm still at the early stages of this journey.",
